   ```

### Daily Workflow

1. **Start your day**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

   - Screenshots if UI changes
   - Link to related issues

2. **Request reviews** from 2 team members

3. **Address feedback** and push updates

4. **Get approval** and merge

## üìä Project Management

### Using GitHub Projects

1. **Move issues** between columns as work progresses
2. **Assign issues** to team members
3. **Add labels** for categorization
4. **Set due dates** for time-sensitive tasks

### Labels to Create

- `bug`: Bug fixes
- `enhancement`: New features
- `documentation`: Documentation updates
- `design`: UI/UX changes
- `backend`: Backend changes
- `frontend`: Frontend changes
- `high-priority`: Urgent tasks
- `low-priority`: Nice to have features

### Milestones

Create milestones for major releases:
- **v1.0.0**: Initial release
- **v1.1.0**: Bug fixes and improvements
- **v1.2.0**: New features
- **v2.0.0**: Major redesign

## üîß Advanced Setup

### GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '18'
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm test
```

### Issue Templates

Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`:
```markdown
---
name: Bug report
about: Create a report to help us improve
title: ''
labels: bug
assignees: ''

---

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Commit Messages
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.
- Keep messages clear and descriptive
- Reference issues: `fixes #123`

### Pull Requests
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Include tests for new features
- Update documentation
- Add screenshots for UI changes

### Communication
- Use GitHub Issues for discussions
- Tag team members with @username
- Use reactions to acknowledge messages
- Keep conversations professional

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission denied when pushing**:
- Check if you're added as collaborator
- Verify your SSH keys are set up

**Merge conflicts**:
- Always pull latest changes before starting work
- Communicate with team about conflicting changes
- Use `git status` to see conflicts

**Branch protection blocking merge**:
- Ensure you have required approvals
- Check that all status checks pass
- Make sure branch is up to date

## üéâ Next Steps

1. **Invite your friends** to the repository
2. **Set up the project board** with initial tasks
3. **Create your first feature branch**
4. **Start coding together!**

**Remember**: Communication is key! Use GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and your team chat to stay connected and productive.
